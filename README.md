# The Fjord #

'The Fjord,' is my Project 4 submission, under the 'Project Idea 0' choice of build and design. The site is a blogsite that focuses on all things Nordic! The site features interesting and quirky facts about the Nordic countries. Users have the ability to create profiles on the site, login, like posts, and leave comments. Those with or without a site profile, can search the site for posts using the searchbar on the navbar. They can also fill out a contact form, which displays a success message, when their message is sent.
